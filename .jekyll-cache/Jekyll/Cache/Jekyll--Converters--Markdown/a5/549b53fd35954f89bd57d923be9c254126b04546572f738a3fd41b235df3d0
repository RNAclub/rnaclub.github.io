<p><strong>Our lab will mainly use computational approaches combined with experiments to understand RNA virus and RNA structure at gene expression regulation and structural levels. Specifically, we use RNA structure prediction and RNA design to udnerstand and engineer RNA molecules. We are hosting the <a href="http://www.rnapuzzles.org">RNA-Puzzles</a>, which is a world-wide community efforts in evaluation of RNA 3D structure prediction. We explore RNA structural biology using a combination of X-ray crystallography, chemical probing, artificial intelligence and computational modeling. Besides, we use single-cell multi-omics to understand the human immune response to RNA viruses, neuron development and immune cell development. We develop computational algorithms to deal with key bottlenecks in single-cell analysis (e.g.,batch effect, cell type clustering, cell type deconvolution). We also develop cloud computing platform and big data atlases for single-cell omics.</strong></p>
